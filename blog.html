            <h2>Learn HTML-in easy way!</h2>
            <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
                HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
                HTML describes the structure of a Web page
                HTML consists of a series of elements
                HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
                HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
            <p>The !DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
                The html> element is the root element of an HTML page
                The head element contains meta information about the HTML page
                The title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
                The body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
                The h1> element defines a large heading
                The <p> element defines a paragraph</p>

            <h2>Learn CSS-in easy way!</h2>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>
            <p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.

                With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>

            <h2>Learn Javascript-in easy way!</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>

            <h2>Learn PHP-in easy way!</h2>
            <p>What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. You can even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve.

                The best part about using PHP is that it is extremely simple for a newcomer, but offers many advanced features for a professional programmer. Don't be afraid to read the long list of PHP's features. You can jump in, in a short time, and start writing simple scripts in a few hours.</p>
